This project is a simple Random Password Generator built using Python and the Tkinter library for creating a graphical user interface (GUI). The program generates a secure password consisting of letters, numbers, and symbols when the user clicks a button. It also simulates the password generation process with a progress indicator to enhance user experience.

Random Password Generation: The password contains 5 random letters, 3 random numbers, and 1 symbol.
Progress Simulation: A progress bar simulates the process of generating the password.
GUI Interface: The user interacts with a clean and simple graphical interface built using Tkinter.
